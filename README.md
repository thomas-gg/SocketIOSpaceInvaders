To begin run npm install to get dependencies for node_modules

Next type npm run dev or node index and it will be running on localhost:3000

In order to begin the game you must have two clients connected. One way to do this is to have two Chrome windows open and both connect to the same room id (which can be any word you choose). If you have a mobile device which has chrome and is connected to the same wifi as what is running localhost, then you can connect to the game as well by typing "*<your ipaddress\>:3000*"
